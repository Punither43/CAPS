A Proctored Exam Tool with Fullscreen and Anti-Tab Switching ensures exam integrity by monitoring students online. It enforces fullscreen mode, preventing access to other applications. Anti-tab switching detects when students leave the exam tab and triggers alerts. Webcam access allows real-time proctoring, capturing video or images. The tool also disables copy-paste to prevent searching for answers. Logs of user actions, such as tab switches, help identify suspicious behavior.
